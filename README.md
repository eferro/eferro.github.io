3. In "Build and deployment", select:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main` and folder `/ (root)`
4. Save the changes. GitHub will generate the page in a few minutes.
5. The URL will be `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/` if it's a project, or `https://<your-username>.github.io/` if you use the special `<your-username>.github.io` repository.
